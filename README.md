# me.mknn.jp

[me.mknn.jp](https://me.mknn.jp) is the personal portfolio website of Makinon, a software engineer based in Tokyo. The site is built with Astro and is available in English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese.

## Features

- Profile, technical stack, personal projects, and GitHub activity sections
- English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese locales with locale persistence
- Recent GitHub pushes, activity breakdown, and top repositories from the public GitHub API
- Client-side caching for GitHub data with a 24-hour retention period
- Third-party license dialog covering dependencies, fonts, and icons
- Production security and asset caching headers for Cloudflare Pages

## Technology

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) 7
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with the Vite integration
- [astro-icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon) with Lucide and Simple Icons

## Project Routes

| Locale | Path |
| --- | --- |
| English | `/` |
| Japanese | `/ja/` |
| Simplified Chinese | `/zh-cn/` |

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.12.0 or later
- pnpm

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The site is served at `http://localhost:4321` by default.

## Build

Set the public site origin when creating a production build so canonical and Open Graph URLs are generated correctly:

```sh
SITE_URL=https://mknn.jp pnpm build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```sh
pnpm preview
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SITE_URL` | Public origin of the deployed site, including the scheme, such as `https://me.mknn.jp`. Set this in the Cloudflare Pages build environment. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token used by the `/api/contributions` Pages Function to query the GraphQL API. Set it as a secret in the Cloudflare Pages environment. |

Most GitHub data (recent pushes, activity, and top repositories) is fetched from public, unauthenticated endpoints in the browser. The contribution graph is different: it is rendered on demand by a Cloudflare Pages Function that calls the GitHub GraphQL API with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so the token is never exposed to the client.

For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file in the project root (it is git-ignored) so the Cloudflare adapter exposes the token to `Astro.locals.runtime.env`:

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```
